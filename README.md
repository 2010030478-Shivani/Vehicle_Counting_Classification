# Vehicle_Counting_Classification

Vehicle counting and classification can give accurate information about the vehicle on
city road. Vehicle detection and counting are becoming increasingly important in the
field of highway management. However, due to the different sizes of vehicles, their
detection remains a challenge that directly affects the accuracy of vehicle counts. We
will try to address this issue.

Objectives

• This project is to count and classify the vehicles but they can be used to do complex tasks such as number plate recognition, lane recognition etc.
• This has applications in a range of fields such as, public security, accident detection, vehicle theft detection, parking areas and many more
• The vehicles are categorized as small vehicles, which contains small cars and
heavy vehicles.

Conclusion

Vehicle counting and classification projects play an important role in enhancing
traffic management, transportation planning, and road safety, while also contributing
to transportation research and informed decision-making. This project can contribute
significantly to better traffic management, transportation planning, and road safety, as
well as transportation research and informed decision-making.
